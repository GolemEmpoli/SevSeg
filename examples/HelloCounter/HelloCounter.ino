  Hello Count
  Shows numbers from 0 to 9 on a seven segment display.

  Materials:
  * a seven segment display (both common anode and common cathode are ok)
  * 7 resistors (220 Ohm to 470 Ohm are ok)
  Connect the segment pins to Arduino ones, from Digital2 to Digital8.
  More info about connections are shown in README at
  https://bitbucket.org/glgprograms/sevseg
